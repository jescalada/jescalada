### Hey! I'm Juan.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on various projects: our COMP 2800 project, [Bonfire](https://github.com/jescalada/2800-202210-DTC17) and a [Discord bot](https://github.com/jescalada/oppai-chan/).
- 🌱 I’m learning various technologies at BCIT, including JS frameworks and Python. I'm also learning some backend technologies such as Django on my own.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on hackathons this summer! Our team won the Hedera blockchain project award in StormHacks 2022, with our crypto-based marketplace project, [H-mart](https://github.com/jescalada/h-mart). I learnt a lot of backend stuff (express and Hedera JS SDK) as well as front-end integration that weekend!
- 🏆 My teams and I have won two hackathons so far: StormHacks 2022 (by SFU) and Hack the Break 2022 (by BCIT). You can check our submissions [here](https://devpost.com/jescalada).
- 🤔 I’m looking for a co-op job/internship on January 2023. Feel free to contact me for my resume.
- 📫 Want to reach me? Send me an e-mail at [jescalada@my.bcit.ca](mailto:jescalada@my.bcit.ca).
