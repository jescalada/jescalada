### Hey! I'm Juan.

- 🔭 I’m currently a Production Engineering Fellow at MLH Fellowship! We're learning about Site Reliability Engineering/DevOps while making some cool projects:  [Team Pythonic Portfolio](https://github.com/MLH-Fellowship/project-team-pythonic).
- 🌱 I’m learning various technologies at BCIT, including JS frameworks and Python. I'm studying Algorithms and Data Structures in Python by my own.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on hackathons this summer! Our team won the Hedera blockchain project award in StormHacks 2022, with our crypto-based marketplace project, [H-mart](https://github.com/jescalada/h-mart). I learnt a lot of backend stuff (express and Hedera JS SDK) as well as front-end integration that weekend!
- 🏆 My teams and I have won three hackathons so far: StormHacks 2022 (by SFU), Hack the Break 2022 (by BCIT) and the MLH Fellowship Orientation Hackathon. You can check our submissions [here](https://devpost.com/jescalada).
- 🤔 I’m looking for a co-op job/internship on January 2023. Feel free to contact me for my resume.
- 📫 Want to reach me? Send me an e-mail at [jescalada@my.bcit.ca](mailto:jescalada@my.bcit.ca).
